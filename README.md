# InstructorRemoteControl
This repository is for building a tool that, when installed on platform computers such as windows or linux, an instructor can connect to the existing simulator through the network connection that the simulator is connected to. This will be all without having to be on the simulator computer that is hosting the actual simulatin software. In this case the simulation software will be the PX4 software. It is important that this remote control tool be able to communicate over the network and send the commands to the program specifically that runs the simulation software. This will take some time as the developer, primary will need to learn the commands and programming neccesary to communicate over the UDP network or by using ssh as a defualt protocol.
